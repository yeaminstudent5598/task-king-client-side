## Features:
- **Authentication**: Google sign-in via Firebase Authentication.
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete, reorder tasks with drag-and-drop.
- **Categories**: Tasks are organized into "To-Do", "In Progress", and "Done".
- **Real-time Sync**: Instant syncing with the backend for task updates.
